Those informations are the user id the gender the age and the estimated salary. A car company has just launched their brand new luxury SUV. And we're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand new SUV And the last column here tells If yes or no the user bought this SUV we are going to build a model that is going to predict if a user is going to buy or not the SUV based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary. So our matrix of feature is only going to be these two columns. We want to find some correlations between the age and the estimated salary of a user and his decision to purchase yes or no the SUV.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sgTgwccsk5Yu"},"source":["**Step 1 | Data Pre-Processing**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bKWN0MOblEKa"},"source":["**Importing the Libraries**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8cIjONoJj8u0"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2QZwg6ypj8xs"},"source":[],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bM9O8a0YlNWk"},"source":["**Importing the dataset**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vfPLWJHRlM-4"},"source":["df=pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')\n","df"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8LWipIjDj7yn"},"source":["df.describe()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.info()"],"metadata":{"id":"CDLd9ZvbAw84"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"id":"MjHFnIIJAyrF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df=df.drop('User ID',axis=1)\n","label_encode=LabelEncoder()\n","df['Gender']=label_encode.fit_transform(df['Gender'])"],"metadata":{"id":"fu9teHAiA0-t"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eHCKYPHylT5K"},"source":["**Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"o9msgi0sj72h"},"source":["x=df[['Gender','Age','EstimatedSalary']]\n","y=df[['Purchased']]\n","X_Train,X_Test,y_Train,y_Test=train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.25,random_state=2)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AsfmGeH6lZ0O"},"source":["**Feature Scaling**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Xfifr6tlj77A"},"source":["sc=StandardScaler()\n","X_Train=sc.fit_transform(X_Train)\n","X_Test=sc.transform(X_Test)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UkiSpylklf7z"},"source":["**Step 2 | Logistic Regression Model**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rhZgd1t_mfYg"},"source":["The library for this job which is going to be the linear model library and it is called linear because the logistic regression is a linear classifier which means that here since we're in two dimensions, our two categories of users are going to be separated by a straight line.
